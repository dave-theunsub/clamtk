# Introduction #

ClamTk is a GUI front-end for ClamAV using Perl and Gtk libraries.
It is designed to be an easy-to-use, lightweight, on-demand antivirus scanner for Linux systems.
February 2015 will mark our eleventh year!

This page provides information on and downloads for ClamTk and some associated programs - notably, thunar-sendto-clamtk, nemo-sendto-clamtk, and clamtk-kde, which provide context menu functionality for file managers.

**Need assistance?** Please email me or use this [link](http://code.google.com/p/clamtk/issues/list). The [wiki](https://code.google.com/p/clamtk/w/list) pages are not a substitute for this, and will probably go unread.

The builds on this page utilize Gtk2.  A build with a new design for Gtk3 is also underway.  How about a [preview](https://imgur.com/a/2xwEF)?  It's a work in progress. :)
